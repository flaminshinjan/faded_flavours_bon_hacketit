# Faded Flavours

## Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, traditional and authentic recipes are getting lost, and people are increasingly turning towards fast food. To preserve the cultural heritage of food and promote healthy eating habits, there is a need for a platform that can store and share lost recipes. The lack of such a platform has resulted in a significant loss of culinary knowledge, and there is an urgent need to address this issue. The challenge is to create a user-friendly platform that can collect, store, and share traditional recipes from around the world, ensuring that they are accessible to future generations.

## Solution

The Lost Recipes Repository is a platform designed to store and share traditional recipes from around the world. The platform is user-friendly and provides an easy way for users to access lost recipes. Users can search for recipes based on various criteria, such as country, ingredients, or type of cuisine. The platform allows users to contribute their own recipes, ensuring that the repository is always growing.

## Features

- User-friendly platform
- Easy recipe search
- Recipe contribution
- Categorization by country, ingredients, and type of cuisine
- Prep time based recipe recommender
- Recipe Recommender based on ingredients available

## Technologies Used

- App FrontEnd- Swift
- Web FrontEnd- Vite,Tailwind CSS
- Web Backend - MongoDB
- Machine Learning part -python (Pandas, np,sklearn)


## Implementation

In addition to the web platform, we have also developed a machine learning model to predict the dish based on its preparation time and ingredients. This model is trained on a dataset of over 1000 Indian recipes and can be accessed through the platform's API.

We have also developed a Swift app that allows users to access the Lost Recipes Repository on their mobile devices. The app is designed to be user-friendly and includes features such as searching for recipes, adding recipes to favorites, and sharing recipes with friends and family.

To ensure fast and efficient development, we have used Vite and React for frontend development. This allows us to easily add new features and scale the platform as needed.

Users can add their own recipes to the repository, which can be accessed by other users. This allows for the sharing of traditional and authentic recipes, preserving cultural heritage, and promoting healthy eating habits.

In terms of scalability, the platform is designed to handle a large number of users and recipes. The use of MongoDB ensures that the platform can handle a large amount of data, and the implementation of caching ensures fast access to frequently accessed recipes. Additionally, the use of Vite and React allows for easy scaling of the frontend as needed.





## Scalability

The Lost Recipes Repository is designed to be scalable, allowing it to handle a large number of users and recipes. The platform uses MongoDB, which is a scalable NoSQL database that can handle large amounts of data. The platform also uses a cloud hosting service, such as AWS or Google Cloud, to ensure that it can handle a large number of requests.
